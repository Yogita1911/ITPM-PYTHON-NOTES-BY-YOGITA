It is called using dot notation (e.g., `object.method()`). Methods are a part of classes and are used to perform operations on the data within an object or class.\n\nHere are some key concepts related to methods in Python:\n\n### 1. **Instance Methods**:\n   These methods operate on the instance of the class (the object). The first argument for instance methods is usually `self`, which represents the instance itself.\n\n   Example:\n\n   class Dog:\n       def __init__(self, name):\n           self.name = name\n       \n       def speak(self):\n           return f\"{self.name} says Woof!\"\n\n   dog = Dog(\"Rex\")\n   print(dog.speak())  # Output: Rex says Woof!\n\n\n### 2. **Class Methods**:\n   A class method is bound to the class and not the instance of the class. \nIt takes the class itself as its first argument, typically named `cls`. \nYou can define class methods using the `@classmethod` decorator.\n\n   Example:\n\n   class Dog:\n       count = 0\n\n       def __init__(self, name):\n           self.name = name\n           Dog.count += 1\n\n       @classmethod\n       def get_count(cls):\n           return cls.count\n\n   dog1 = Dog(\"Rex\")\n   dog2 = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n   print(Dog.get_count())  # Output: 2\n   ```\n\n### 3. **Static Methods**:\n   Static methods are not bound to any instance or class. \nThey don't take `self` or `cls` as the first parameter. \nStatic methods are used for utility functions that don't need access to class or instance data.\nYou can define static methods using the `@staticmethod` decorator.\n\n   Example:\n\n   class Math:\n       @staticmethod\n       def add(a, b):\n           return a + b\n\n   result = Math.add(3, 5)\n   print(result)  # Output: 8\n   ```\n\n### 4. **Dunder (Magic) Methods**:\n   Dunder methods (or magic methods) are special methods that Python uses for certain operations like object creation, \nstring representation, etc. They are prefixed and suffixed with double underscores (`__`), \nsuch as `__init__`, `__str__`, `__add__`, etc.\n\n   Example:\n\n   class Point:\n       def __init__(self, x, y):\n           self.x = x\n           self.y = y\n\n       def __str__(self):\n           return f\"Point({self.x}, {self.y})\"\n       \n       def __add__(self, other):\n           return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)\n\n   p1 = Point(2, 3)\n   p2 = Point(4, 5)\n   print(p1 + p2)  # Output: Point(6, 8)\n   ```\n\n### 5. **Instance vs. Class Method vs. Static Method**:\n   - **Instance Method**: Requires an instance of the class and can access instance-specific data.\n   - **Class Method**: Works with class-level data, not instance-level data.\n   - **Static Method**: Does not depend on either the instance or the class. It's a utility function that works independently.\n\n### Summary of Common Method Types:\n- **`__init__(self)`**: Constructor method, initializes a new object.\n- **`__str__(self)`**: Provides string representation of an object.\n- **`__repr__(self)`**: Returns a \"formal\" string representation of an object, useful for debugging.\n- **`__add__(self, other)`**: Used to define the behavior of the addition operator (`+`) for objects.\n- **`@classmethod`**: Used to define a method bound to the class.\n- **`@staticmethod`**: Used to define a method that does not depend on the class or instance.\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Car:\n    car_count = 0\n\n    def __init__(self, make, model):\n        self.make = make\n        self.model = model\n        Car.car_count += 1\n\n    @classmethod\n    def from_string(cls, car_string):\n        make, model = car_string.split('-')\n        return cls(make, model)\n\n    @classmethod\n    def get_car_count(cls):\n        return cls.car_count\n\n\n# Creating an instance using the class method\ncar_string = \"Toyota-Corolla\"\ncar1 = Car.from_string(car_string)\n\nprint(car1.make)  # Output: Toyota\nprint(car1.model)  # Output: Corolla\nprint(Car.get_car_count())  # Output: 1\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Calculator:\n    \n    @staticmethod\n    def add(a, b):\n        return a + b\n    \n    @staticmethod\n    def multiply(a, b):\n        return a * b\n    \n    @staticmethod\n    def power(base, exponent):\n        return base ** exponent\n\n# Calling static methods without creating an instance of the class\nresult_add = Calculator.add(5, 3)\nresult_multiply = Calculator.multiply(4, 2)\nresult_power = Calculator.power(2, 3)\n\nprint(result_add)      \nprint(result_multiply) \nprint(result_power)    \n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
