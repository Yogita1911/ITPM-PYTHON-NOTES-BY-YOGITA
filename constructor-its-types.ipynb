Introduction to Constructors in Python**\n\nIn Python, a **constructor** is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. The constructor is used to initialize the object’s state (i.e., assign values to the object's properties or instance variables).\n\nIn Python, the constructor method is called `__init__`. This method is part of the class and is used to initialize an instance of that class. \n\nThe `self` Parameter**\nIn all constructors in Python, `self` is the first parameter, which refers to the instance of the class being created. It is automatically passed by Python when you create an object, and you don’t need to pass it explicitly.\n\n### Types of Constuctor : 1.Default 2.Parameterized  3.Constructor with Default Arguments*","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class MyClass:\n    def __init__(self, parameter1, parameter2):\n        self.parameter1 = parameter1\n        self.parameter2 = parameter2\n        print(\"Constructor is called\")\n\n# Creating an object of the class\nobj = MyClass(value1, value2)\n```","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\n'''The `self` Parameter**\nIn all constructors in Python, `self` is the first parameter, which refers to the instance of the class being created.
