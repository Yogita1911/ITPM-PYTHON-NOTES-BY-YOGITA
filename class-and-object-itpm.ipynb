It breaks down a program into smaller functions that perform specific tasks. The focus is on a sequence of tasks to be performed.\n- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Centers around objects and classes. Objects represent real-world entities, and a class defines the blueprint for these objects. The focus is on encapsulating data and behavior together.\n\n### 2. **Structure**\n- **POP**: Code is organized as functions or procedures. Data is often separate from the procedures, making it harder to manage and maintain relationships between data and functions.\n- **OOP**: Code is organized as objects. Each object contains data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data. This bundling of data and functions into objects helps maintain a clear structure.\n\n### 3. **Data Handling**\n- **POP**: Data is generally passed between functions and can be vulnerable to changes from outside, leading to potential data inconsistency.\n- **OOP**: Data is encapsulated within objects. This encapsulation restricts direct access to the internal state, ensuring better data integrity and security.\n\n### 4. **Modularity and Reusability**\n- **POP**: Functions can be reused, but often with more complexity. Reusability is limited as functions do not carry data, requiring complex parameter passing.\n- **OOP**: Encourages reusability through inheritance and polymorphism. Classes and objects can be extended and reused with less redundancy and greater flexibility.\n\n### 5. **Maintenance and Scalability**\n- **POP**: As the size of the program grows, maintaining and modifying it becomes more difficult due to the lack of a structured approach.\n- **OOP**: Easier to maintain and scale because objects can be modified independently without affecting other parts of the program, leading to better code maintainability.\n\n### 6. **Examples**\n- **POP**: Languages like **C**, **Fortran**, and **Pascal**.\n- **OOP**: Languages like **Java**, **C++**, **Python**, and **C#**.\n\n### 7. **Key Principles in OOP**\n- **Encapsulation**: Bundles data and methods into a single unit (object).\n- **Abstraction**: Simplifies complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem.\n- **Inheritance**: Enables a new class to inherit characteristics from an existing class.\n- **Polymorphism**: Allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, making it easier to swap out implementations.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Class\n#### A class is a blueprint for creating objects.\n#### It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have.\n#### Think of a class as a template or a prototype. \n#### For example, if you have a Car class, \n#### it might have attributes like color, model, and year, and methods like start() or stop().\n#### Object: An instance of a class.
