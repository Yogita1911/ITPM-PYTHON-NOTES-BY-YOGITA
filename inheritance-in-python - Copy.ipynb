Inheritance has the following characteristics:\n\n### It is an excellent representation of relationships in the real world.\n### It allows code reuse. It doesn't require us to create the same code repeatedly and again. It also allows us to add options to an existing class without having to modify the existing code.\n### It is a transitive nature, meaning that if B is inherited from another class A, all the subclasses belonging to B will inherit directly from class A.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Types of Inheritance in Python\n#### The types of inheritance depend on the number of children and parents involved.\n\n### There are four kinds of inheritance available in Python:\n\n## 1.Single Inheritance \n#### Single inheritance allows a derivate class to inherit properties of one parent class, and this allows code reuse and the introduction of additional features in existing code.\n\n## 2.Multiple Inheritance \n#### If a class is able to be created from multiple base classes, this kind of Inheritance is known as multiple Inheritance. When there is multiple Inheritance, each of the attributes that are present in the classes of the base has been passed on to the class that is derived from it.\n\n### 3.Multilevel inheritance, \n#### the features that are part of the original class, as well as the class that is derived from it, are passed on to the new class. It is similar to a relationship involving grandparents and children.\n\n### 4.Hierarchical Inheritance:\n#### If multiple derived classes are created from the same base, this kind of Inheritance is known as hierarchical inheritance. In this instance, we have two base classes as a parent (base) class as well as two children (derived) classes.\n  \n        \n   \n\n  \n    \n        \n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Python program for demonstrating single inheritance  \n  \n# Here, we will create the base class or the Parent class  \nclass Parent1:  \n    def func_1(self):  \n        print (\"This function is defined inside the parent class.\")  \n  \n  \nclass Child1(Parent1):  \n    def func_2(self):  \n        print (\"This function is defined inside the child class.\")  \n  \n  \nobject = Child1()  \nobject.func_1()  \nobject.func_2()  ","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Python program for demonstrating multiple inheritance \n# Here, we will create the Base class 1  \nclass Mother1:  \n    mothername1 = \"\"  \n    def mother1(self):  \n        print(self.mothername1)  \n  \n # Here, we will create the Base class 2  \nclass Father1:  \n    fathername1 = \"\"  \n    def father1(self):  \n        print(self.fathername1)  \n  \n # now, we will create the Derived class  \nclass Son1(Mother1, Father1):  \n    def parents1(self):  \n        print (\"Father name is :\", self.fathername1)  \n        print (\"Mother name is :\", self.mothername1)  \n  # Driver's code  \ns1 = Son1()  \ns1.fathername1 = \"Rajesh\"  \ns1.mothername1 = \"Shreya\"  \ns1.parents1()  ","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Python program for demonstrating multilevel inheritance \n# Here, we will create the Base class   \nclass Grandfather1:  \n  \n    def __init__(self, grandfathername1):  \n        self.grandfathername1 = grandfathername1  \n \n # here, we will create the Intermediate class  \nclass Father1(Grandfather1):  \n    def __init__(self, fathername1, grandfathername1):  \n        self.fathername1 = fathername1  \n  \n        # here, we will invoke the constructor of Grandfather class  \n        Grandfather1.__init__(self, grandfathername1)  \n  \n # here, we will create the Derived class  \nclass Son1(Father1):  \n    def __init__(self,sonname1, fathername1, grandfathername1):  \n        self.sonname1 = sonname1  \n  \n        # here, we will invoke the constructor of Father class  \n        Father1.__init__(self, fathername1, grandfathername1)  \n  \n    def print_name(self):  \n        print('Grandfather name is :', self.grandfathername1)  \n        print(\"Father name is :\", self.fathername1)  \n        print(\"Son name is :\", self.sonname1)  \n  \n  \ns1 = Son1('John', 'John Jr', 'John Jr Jr')  \nprint (s1.grandfathername1)  \ns1.print_name()  ","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Python program for demonstrating Hierarchical inheritance  \n  \n# Here, we will create the Base class   \nclass Parent1:  \n    def func_1(self):  \n        print (\"This function is defined inside the parent class.\")  \n  \n # Derived class1  \nclass Child_1(Parent1):  \n    def func_2(self):  \n        print (\"This function is defined inside the child 1.\")  \n  \n # Derivied class2  \nclass Child_2(Parent1):  \n    def func_3(self):  \n        print (\"This function is defined inside the child 2.\")  \n  \n  \nobject1 = Child_1()  \nobject2 = Child_2()  \nobject1.func_1()  \nobject1.func_2()  \nobject2.func_1()  \nobject2.func_3()  ","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
